# Data Wrangling

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6)
```

These notes pertain to chapter 5 in Wickham and Grolemund's text. We'll consider data from Major League Baseball, available through the `Lahman()` package. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
select <- dplyr::select
summarize <- dplyr::summarize
```

We create a tibble with batting records for all MLB players from 1871-2020 

```{r}
batting <- as_tibble(Lahman::Batting)
head(batting)
```

```{r}
tail(batting)
```

```{r}
summary(batting)
```

```{r}
dim(batting)
```



## Filtering and Arranging Data, and Selecting Columns

The `filter()` command narrows a dataset to rows that meet a specified condition. 

The `arrange()` command sorts a dataset according to a specified ordering. 

The `select()` command narrows a dataset to a specified set of columns

These commands are part of the `dplyr` R package, which itself is part of `tidyverse`. 

### Example 2.1.1 {-}

Using the baseball data, create a tibble with only data from the most recent season available (2020).

```{r}
batting2020 <- batting %>% filter(yearID == 2020)
head(batting2020)
```


An equivalent way to do this is:

```{r}
batting2020 <- filter(batting, yearID == 2020)
head(batting2020)
```

We'll use the first way, though. The %>% operator (called **pipe**) has advantages and makes coding more convenient when stringing together multiple operations. 

### Example 2.1.2  {-}

Create a tibble including only players who played for teams currently in the National League Central division: Milwaukee (MIL), Chicago Cubs (CHN), Pittsburgh (PIT), Cincinnati (CIN), and St. Louis (SLN). 

```{r}
batting_NLCentral <- batting %>% filter(teamID %in% c("MIL", "CHN", "PIT", "CIN", "SNL"))
head(batting_NLCentral)
```

### Example 2.1.3   {-}

Order the entire baseball tibble from most homeruns to fewest. 

Note: we use `desc()` to sort in descending order. To sort in ascending order, simply put the name of the variable, i.e. `HR`.
```{r}
batting %>% arrange(desc(HR))
```

### Example 2.1.4    {-}

Create a tibble that contains only the columns `playerID`, `yearID`, `teamID`, `AB`, `H`, and `HR`. 

```{r}
batting1 <- batting %>% select(playerID, yearID, teamID, AB, H, HR)
head(batting1)
```

### Example 2.1.5    {-}

The `%>%` (pipe) operator allows us to string together multiple commands. 

Create a tibble including only players who batted at least 500 times in a season and played for Milwaukee (MIL) during or after the 2000 season. Include the columns `playerID`, `yearID`, and `RBI`, and order the players by most RBI to fewest.

```{r}
batting_MIL <- batting %>% filter(teamID == "MIL" & yearID >= 2000) %>%
              select(playerID, yearID, RBI) %>%
              arrange(desc(RBI))
head(batting_MIL)
```


### Practice 2.1.6    {-}

Create a subset of the data that includes only players who played in the American League (AL) after 1950. 

```{r}
#Type code here
```

### Practice 2.1.7     {-}

Create a tibble containing all players, but only the variables `playerID`, `yearID`, "G", "H", and "HR". 

```{r}
#Type code here
```

### Practice 2.1.8    {-}

Order the rows from most hits in a season to fewest. 

```{r}
#Type code here
```



### Example 2.1.9 Multiple Logicals      {-}

The current Washington Nationals franchise previously played in Montreal from 1969-2004, and was known as the Expos. Create a dataset containing statistics for this franchise, including both its time in Montreal, and Washington. Arrange in descending order by number of homeruns. 


```{r}
batting_MON_WAS <- batting %>% filter( (teamID=="MON" & yearID >= 1969 & yearID <= 2004)
                         | (teamID=="WAS" & yearID >= 2005)) %>% arrange(desc(HR))
batting_MON_WAS
```

```{r}
head(batting_MON_WAS)
```

```{r}
tail(batting_MON_WAS)
```

### Example 2.1.10: Dealing with NA's              {-}

For some batters, stolen base data (SB) were not available. Filter the dataset to only include rows for which stolen base data were available. 

The `is.na()` command returns TRUE/FALSE depending on whether the value is missing(NA). Here we use the negation operator `!`, since we want the rows that are not na's. 

```{r}
battingSB <- batting %>% filter(!is.na(SB))
```

```{r}
dim(battingSB)
```

```{r}
dim(batting)
```


### Practice 2.1.11           {-}

Create a tibble that contains only players who played in every one of their team's games in a season. Only consider seasons from 1904 on, since season length was highly variable prior to 1904. 

Note that beginning in 1904, teams played 154 games per season. In 1961, the American League (AL) expanded to 162 games. The National League expanded to 162 games in 1962. From 1962-2019, teams played 162 games per season. In 2020, teams only played 60 games, due to covid-19.   


```{r}
# Enter code here
```

### Practice 2.1.12              {-}

Create a tibble that contains only players who played for Milwaukee in 2020, but contains statistics from all years in these player's careers, whether or not they played for Milwaukee. 

For example since Christian Yelich played for Milwaukee in 2020, all of his seasons should be included in the dataset, including 2013-2017, when he did not play for Milwaukee. 

Include the variables `playerID`, `yearID`, `teamID`, `AB`, `H`, and `HR`, and order the dataframe in descending order by homeruns (HR). 


```{r}
#Enter code here
```


## Mutating, Summarizing, and Grouping Data

The `mutate` and `transmute` functions allow us to create new variables in a dataset from old ones.  

### Example 2.2.1           {-}

A player's **batting average** is defined as number of hits (H) divided by number of at-bats (AB). 

A player's **on-base percentage** is defined as number of hits (H), walks (BB), times hit by pitch (HBP), divided by number of at-bats, walks, times hit by pitch, and sacrifice flies (SF). 

A player's slugging percentage is defined as singles + 2\times doubles (X2B) + 3 \times triples (X3B) + 4 \times homeruns (HR) divided by number of at-bats. 

We'll create each of these variables. Note that since singles is not a variable in the dataset, we'll create it by subtracting doubles, triples, and homeruns from hits. 

```{r}
batting %>% mutate(AVG = H / AB,
                                  OBP = (H + BB + HBP) / (AB + BB + HBP +SF),
                                  X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR,
                                  SLG = (X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4* HR) / AB) %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, AB, H, HR, BB, HBP, SF, AVG, OBP, SLG)
```

While `mutate` displays all variables in the dataset, `transmute` displays only the ones created. 

```{r}
batting %>% transmute(AVG = H / AB,
                                  OBP = (H + BB + HBP) / (AB + BB + HBP +SF),
                                  X1B = H - X2B - X3B - HR,
                                  SLG = (X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4* HR) / AB) 
```


### Example 2.2.2              {-}

Create a new variable that indicates whether or not a player played for a team currently in the National League Central Division (MIL, CIN, CHN, CIN, PIT).

```{r}
batting %>% mutate(NLCentral = ifelse(teamID %in%c("MIL", "CIN", "CHN", "CIN", "PIT"), "Yes", "No")) %>%
  select(playerID,  yearID, teamID, NLCentral)
```


### Summarize

The `summarize` command calculates summary statistics for all variables in the dataset. 

The `n()` command returns the number of rows included in the summary. 


### Example 2.2.3                      {-}

Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and upper and lower quartiles for number stolen bases 

```{r, error=TRUE}
batting %>% summarize(min_SB = min(SB), 
                      Q1_SB = quantile(SB, 0.25),
                      median_SB = median(SB),
                      Q3_SB = quantile(SB, 0.75), 
                      max_SB = max(SB), 
                      mean_SB =mean(SB),
                      Number = n())
```

The quantities we desire cannot be calculated some players have missing values. We tell R to ignore missing values using the argument `na.rm=TRUE`.

```{r}
batting %>% summarize(min_SB = min(SB, na.rm=TRUE), 
                      Q1_SB = quantile(SB, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE),
                      median_SB = median(SB, na.rm=TRUE),
                      Q3_SB = quantile(SB, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE), 
                      max_SB = max(SB, na.rm=TRUE), 
                      mean_SB =mean(SB, na.rm=TRUE),
                      Number = sum(!is.na(SB)))
```



### Practice 2.2.4                       {-}

Create a variable to calculate each player's stolen base success proportion (SB/(SB+CS)). 

```{r}
#Enter Code Here
```


### Practice 2.2.5                       {-}

Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and upper and lower quartiles for humber hits. Also give the total number of players in the dataset.

```{r}
#Enter Code Here
```



### Example 2.2.6              {-}

While overall summaries are sometimes useful, often it is far more useful to summarize by group. The `group_by` command allows us to calculate summary statistics broken down by group. 

Calculate the number of homeruns (HR), hits (H), and at-bats (AB) for by each team, throughout baseball history. 

When grouping, `n()` returns the number of observations in each group. 

```{r}
batting %>% group_by(teamID) %>% 
  summarize(HR = sum(HR),
            H= sum(H), 
            AB= sum(AB),
            Total_Player_Seasons = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```

While we might be interested in knowing the number of total player seasons for each team, it might be more interesting to know the number of different batters who have played for each team. We can accomplish this using the `unique()` function. The command `unique(playerID)` creates a vector of unique player ID's for each team. The `length()` command returns the length of each vector (i.e. number of different batters). 

```{r}
batting %>% group_by(teamID) %>% 
  summarize(HR = sum(HR),
            H= sum(H), 
            AB= sum(AB),
            Total_Batters = length(unique(playerID))
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```

### Example 2.2.7              {-}

Calculate each team's all-time batting average. Include only teams with at least 100,000 at-bats. Sort by batting average. 


```{r}
batting %>% group_by(teamID) %>% 
  summarize(HR = sum(HR),
            H= sum(H), 
            AB= sum(AB),
            Total_Batters = length(unique(playerID)),
            AVG = H / AB
  ) %>%
  filter(AB > 100000) %>%
  arrange(desc(AVG))
```

### Example 2.2.8              {-}

Some of these teams do not exist anymore, while others came about more recently. Let's include the earliest and latest year that each team played. 

```{r}
batting %>% group_by(teamID) %>% 
  summarize(HR = sum(HR),
            H= sum(H), 
            AB= sum(AB),
            Total_Batters = length(unique(playerID)),
            AVG = H / AB,
            First_Year = min(yearID),
            Last_Year = max(yearID)
  ) %>%
  filter(AB > 100000) %>%
  arrange(desc(AVG))
```

### Example 2.2.9              {-}

We can group by more than one variable. Let's calculate the number of hits, homeruns, and at-bats, and batting average for each team in each season. 

```{r}
batting %>% group_by(teamID, yearID) %>% 
  summarize(HR = sum(HR),
            H= sum(H), 
            AB= sum(AB),
            AVG = H / AB
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```

### Practice 2.2.10              {-}

Calculate the total number of at-bats (AB), hits (H), and homeruns (HR) for each player throughout their career. Also calculate their career batting average (H / AB). Sort the dataset from most hits to fewest. 

```{r}
#Enter Code Here
```

### Practice 2.2.11    {-}

Calculate the total number of records (rows) for each player in the dataset. Order from most to least. Also include the player's first and last season. Note that some players played non-consecutive seasons, so the number of records will not necessarily equal the difference between the first and last seasons.

```{r}
#Enter Code Here
```

### Practice 2.2.12           {-}

The total number of records for each player is not quite equal to their total number of seasons played, since players sometimes play for more than one team in a season. Calculate the total number of seasons played by each player. 

```{r}
#Enter Code Here
```


### Practice 2.2.13         {-}

Calculate the average number of stolen bases and homeruns per team for each year since 1871. For example, the average number of homeruns per team was 226.      

```{r}
#Enter Code Here
```


Plot the average number of homeruns and stolen bases against year. 

```{r}
#Enter Code Here

## Tidy Data

Data are stored in many different forms. Some are easier to work with than others. Packages in `tidyverse` (`gglot2`, `dplyr`, etc.) are designed to work with tidy data. This means:

* Each variable must have its own column.    
* Each observation must have its own row.     
* Each value must have its own cell.     

Note that any two of these imply the third. 


Since data often come in non-tidy form, we often need to reshape our data before creating graphs or calculating summary statistics. Often, we see either: 

1. one variable spread across multiple columns  OR
2. one observation spread across multiple rows

Such data can be reshaped into tidy form using the `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()` commands. 

### Example 2.3.1: `pivot_longer()` {-}

We consider a dataset containing results from a [10 week sensory experiment on french fries](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/reshape/versions/0.8.8/topics/French%20fries), conducted at Iowa State University in 2004. 

* 12 individuals were asked to assess the taste of french fries according to how they taste with respect to five different criteria:     
     - potato-y      
     - buttery      
     - grassy     
     - rancid      
     - paint-y     
     
* fries were fried in 1 of 3 different oils (treatment). Each week, individuals tasted and assessed six batches of fries (all three oils, replicated twice)


```{r}
Fries <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewjSage/andrewjsage.github.io/master/Datasets/frenchfries.csv")
Fries
```

* Suppose we want to create a boxplot displaying ratings for each of the five critera, while faceting by type of oil (`treatment`). Can we do this with the data in its current format? Why or why not?


Note that in format 1, the column names `potato`, `buttery`, `grassy`, `rancid`, `painty` are not names of variables, but rather categories (or levels) of the variable `criterion`. Thus, each row represents 5 observations, not 1. 

The `pivot_longer()` command converts a "wide" dataset like format 1 into a "longer" tidy form. 

```{r}
Fries_tidy <- Fries %>% pivot_longer(cols = c("potato", "buttery", "grassy", "rancid", "painty"), 
                                      names_to = "criterion", values_to="rating")
```

* `cols` specifies the columns whose names should be made into the values, or levels of a single variable.   
* `names_to` specifies the name of the variable to be made out of the column names.    
* `values_to` specifies the name of the variable that will contain the values in these columns of the dataset. (Note that quotes are required when creating variables whose names do not exist in the original dataset.)    

```{r}
head(Fries_tidy)
```

Now, we can create the plot we desire. 

```{r}
ggplot(data=Fries_tidy) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=criterion, y=rating)) + facet_grid(~treatment) + coord_flip()
```

We can save a .csv file containing the new dataset using the `write.csv` command

```{r}
write.csv(Fries_tidy, file="Fries_tidy.csv")
```


### Example 2.3.2 `pivot_wider`  {-}

This dataset gives the median annual income and median monthly rent in 2017 for each of the 50 US states. 

`estimate` represents the estimated monthly income or rent, and `moe` represents the margin of error for that estimate. 

```{r}
head(us_rent_income)
```

Why are these data not in tidy form?


What would happen if we tried to create a histogram of annual rent estimates?



We use the `pivot_wider()` command to reshape these data into tidy form. 

```{r}
us_rent_income_tidy <- us_rent_income %>% pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from=c("estimate", "moe"))
head(us_rent_income_tidy)
```

* `names_from` specifies the single column to be spread over multiple columns. 
* `values_from` specifies the variables from which to obtain the values for the new columns

By default, new column names will consist of the old column names and the variables in `names_from`, separated by a _

```{r}
ggplot(data = us_rent_income_tidy) +geom_histogram(aes(x=estimate_rent), binwidth=100)
```


### Example 2.3.3 `separate()` and `unite()`   {-}

Sometimes, we need to split a column into two columns. This can be done using the `separate()` command. For example, the following dataset has a variable called `rate`, which gives the ratio of cases of TB in various countries, to the country's population. 

Let's create two columns, one with the number of TB cases, and the other with population. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
TBcases <- table3
head(TBcases)
```

```{r}
TBcases_sep <- TBcases %>% separate("rate", into = c("TB_cases", "population"), sep="/")
head(TBcases_sep)
```

Notice that the new columns are listed as character vectors, even though they are numeric. We can tell R to convert the resulting columns using the command `convert=TRUE`. 

```{r}
TBcases_sep <- TBcases %>% separate("rate", into = c("TB_cases", "population"), sep="/", convert=TRUE)
head(TBcases_sep)
```

If we want to return to the initial form, we can combine the variables back into one using `unite()`

```{r}
TBcases_united <- TBcases_sep %>% unite(col="rate", "TB_cases", "population", sep="/")
head(TBcases_united)
```


### Practice 2.3.4   {-}

The GDP growth dataset contains each country's annual GDP growth in each year since 1800. The data are in a format where columns represent years.  

```{r}
GDP_Growth <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewjSage/andrewjsage.github.io/master/Datasets/gdp_total_yearly_growth.csv")
```

Suppose we wanted to plot a country's GDP growth over time. Why wouldn't we be able to do that with the data in its current form?

Reshape the data into a format with three columns: `country`, `year`, and `GDP_Growth`. 

Hint: you can reference all columns between 1801 and 2013, using  `c("1801":"2013"). 

```{r}
#type code here. 
```


You should notice that the `year` variable is stored as a character. Convert it to an integer using the command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
GDP_Growth <- GDP_Growth %>%  mutate(year=as.integer(year))
```  




Now plot GPD_Growth by year for Brazil, China, India, the United States, and Vietnam. Use a line graph to connect the points. 

```{r}
#type code here
```


Create a .csv file containing the new version of the dataset. 

```{r}
#type code here
```


### Practice 2.3.5   {-}

The `fish_encounters` dataset contains data on fish migration along a river. Sensors were setup at multiple stations along the river, and the data show whether the fish was observed at each station. Notice that there are many rows for each fish, corresponding to each station where the fish was observed. If a fish was not observed at a station, then that row is omitted from the dataset. 

```{r}
data("fish_encounters")
head(fish_encounters)
```

Reshape the data so that each fish has exactly one row in the data, columns correspond to the different stations, and the entry in the cell correponding to a fish and station has value 1 if the fish was seen at that station. (See illustration.)   

```{r}
# Type code here
```

If we add `values_fill = 0` in the pivot command, NA's will be replaced with 0's.  

### Practice 2.3.6   {-}

The following code scrapes the Milwaukee Bucks roster from `espn.com`. We'll learn about how to scrape data from the web later in the term.  

```{r}
library(rvest)
page <- read_html("https://www.espn.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/mil")
table <- page %>%
html_elements("table") %>%
html_table()
Bucks <- table[[1]]
Bucks
```

Notice that the `HT` variable includes both feet and inches, separated by the ' symbol. 

We'll want to separate the `HT` variable into two separate numeric variables, `FT` and `IN`. 

First, we'll remove the " symbol after inches, using the code below. You'll learn more about the `str_replace()` function soon. 

```{r}
Bucks$HT <- str_replace(Bucks$HT, '"', "")
Bucks
```

Now, separate the `HT` variable into two variables, called `FT` and `IN`. Make sure they are both numeric variables. 

```{r}
#Type code here
```


## Joining Data

### Mutating Joins  {-}

A mutating join adds new variables to a dataframe by matching observations in another. 

```{r}
library(Lock5Data)
data(AllCountries)
countries <- AllCountries
```

```{r}
glimpse(countries)
```


```{r}
head(countries)
```

Let's graph each country's life expectancy against its GDP, as we saw in the GapMinder graphic. 

```{r}
ggplot(data=countries) + geom_point(aes(y=LifeExpectancy, x=GDP, size=Population)) + scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log2')
```

We cannot color by continent because continent is not a variable in our dataset. Fortunately, we can find the countries in each continent from another source. 

```{r}
continents <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbouquin/IS_608/master/NanosatDB_munging/Countries-Continents.csv")
glimpse(continents)
```

```{r}
head(continents)
```

In order to join the dataframes together, we need a **key**. A **key** is a variable, or set of variables, that uniquely identifies an observation. Keys are used to match observations. 

Used to connect two data tables

- **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table

- **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table


There are four different kinds of mutating joins in R. 

1. `inner_join` matches pairs of observations when their keys are equal. The new dataframe contains only observations that were contained in both of the original ones. 

2. `left_join` keeps all observations from the left (x) table. Those not matched return NA's for the variables in the y-table. 

3. `right_join` keeps all observations from the right (y) table. Those not matched return NA's for the variables in the x-table.   

4. `full_join` keeps all observations in both tables. Those not matched return NA's for variables in the other table. 

**Inner**

![inner join illustration](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-inner.png)


![outer join illustration](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-outer.png)


### Example 2.4.1 Joining countries and continents     {-}

a) Using `inner_join` 
```{r}
countries_inner <- countries %>% inner_join(continents, by="Country") %>% 
  select(Country, Continent, everything())
head(countries_inner)
```

```{r}
dim(countries_inner)
```

b) Using `left_join` 
```{r}
countries_left <- countries %>% left_join(continents, by="Country") %>% 
  select(Country, Continent, everything())
head(countries_left)
```

```{r}
dim(countries_left)
```


c) Using `right_join` 
```{r}
countries_right <- countries %>% right_join(continents, by="Country") %>% 
  select(Country, Continent, everything())
head(countries_right)
```

```{r}
dim(countries_right)
```

d) Using `full_join` 
```{r}
countries_full <- countries %>% full_join(continents, by="Country") %>% 
  select(Country, Continent, everything())
head(countries_full)
```

```{r}
dim(countries_full)
```


We'll create a new .csv file with the dataset we created. 

```{r}
write.csv(countries_full, file="Countries_Full.csv")
```


**Notes:**   
* If we do not specify a `by` argument, R will join datasets using a key consisting of all varaibles that appear in both datasets.    

* If the datasets use different names for the same variable, join using `by=c("variablename_x"= "variablename_y")`. For example, if the variable `Country` were instead called `country` in the `countries` dataset and `ctry` in the `Continents` dataset, we would use `inner_join(countries, continents, by=c("country"="ctry"))`. 


We create two small fictional datasets. `Students` contains a list of fictional student id's, and the courses the students are enrolled in. Note there is a separate line for each course. `Costs` contains the total cost of textbooks and other materials for each course. 


```{r}
id <- c(10576, 10576, 10576, 11439, 11439, 19857, 11306, 11306, 12576, 12576)
course <-c("Calculus", "Art", "Economics", "Calculus", "Shakespeare", "History", "Economics", "Statistics", "Art", "Shakespeare")
Students <- data.frame(id, course)
Students
```

```{r}
course <- c("Calculus", "Economics", "Shakespeare", "History", "Engineering")
book_cost <- c(90, 75, 50, 80, 100)
Costs <- data.frame(course, book_cost)
Costs
```




### Practice 2.4.2      {-}

#### Use one of the join commands to create the following datasets.

#### a) a dataset whose first two columns are identical to `Students`, and whose third column contains the `book_cost` for each course. If the course does not appear in the `Costs` dataset, return `NA`. 

```{r}
# Type code here
```

#### b) a dataset like the one in (a), but which excludes courses whose book costs are not listed   

```{r}
# Type code here
```

#### c) a dataset that lists each course in the `Costs` dataset along with the number of students taking the course, and the cost of books. Hint: you will need to do some data wrangling before joining the data. 

```{r}
# Type code here
```



### Filtering Joins     {-}

A filtering join filters observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

There are two types of filtering joins:

* `semi_join(x, y)` keeps all observations in dataframe `x` that have a match in dataframe `y`   
     ![semi join illustration](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-semi.png)
* `anti_join(x, y)` drops all observations in dataframe `x` that have a match in dataframe `y`.
     ![anti join illustration](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-anti.png)


Anti-joins are useful for diagnosing join mismatches.


### Example 2.4.3 Joining countries and continents     {-}

Use semi_join to create a dataset of all countries in continents whose total land area is greater than 20 million square km. (Note: land area is given in thousands of square km.)

```{r}
Large_Area <- countries_full %>% group_by(Continent) %>% 
  summarize(total_area = sum(LandArea, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% filter(total_area > 20000)
head(Large_Area)
```

```{r}
countries_full %>% semi_join(Large_Area) %>% head()
```

Use anti-join to find the countries contained in the full-join of the datasets that are not contained in the inner-join.

```{r}
countries_full %>% anti_join(countries_inner, by="Country")
```


We'll create the life-expectancy plot, colored by continent. 

```{r}
ggplot(data=countries_inner) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=LifeExpectancy, x=GDP, size=Population, color = Continent)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log2')
```

### Practice 2.4.4      {-}

Continue working with the `Students` and `Costs` datasets. 

#### a) Create and display a dataset containing all courses, listed in `Costs` that at least one student is taking, along with the cost of books for the course. 

```{r}
# Type code here
```

#### b) Create and display a dataset listing the id's of all students who are taking a course not listed in `Costs`, as well as the unlisted course they are taking. 

```{r}
# Type code here
```




## Strings, Factors and Dates   

### Example 2.5.1: Modifying String Variables  {-}

We scrape the Milwaukee Bucks roster from ESPN.com

```{r}
library(rvest)
page <- read_html("https://www.espn.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/mil")
table <- page %>%
html_elements("table") %>%
html_table()
Bucks <- table[[1]]
Bucks <- Bucks %>% select(-c(1))
Bucks
```

We'll perform several steps to clean the data. 

```{r}
Bucks <- Bucks %>% mutate(HT = str_remove(HT, '"'),             # remove " from heights
                 WT = str_remove(WT, "lbs"),                    # remove "lbs" from weights
                 Salary = str_remove_all(Salary, c("\\$|,")),   # remove $ and , from salary - put \\ in front of special chars.
                 College = str_replace(College, "--", "NA"),    # replace -- with NA for colleges
                 WT = as.numeric(WT),                           # convert salaries and weights to numeric
                 Salary = as.numeric(Salary),
                 POS = as.factor(POS)                           # convert positions to factor (categorical) variable
                 )
```

Now, we'll separate the player's uniform number from their name.  In the notation in the `sep` operator, tells R to separate at the location in the string that lies between a lower case letter and a digit. The `?>=` says "this should be on the left" and the `?=` says "this should be on the right".   

```{r}
Bucks %>%
  separate(Name, into = c("Name", "Number"), sep = "(?<=[a-z])(?=[0-9])", convert=TRUE) %>%
  separate(HT, into = c("FT", "IN"), convert=TRUE)    
```

### Practice 2.5.2: {-}

We'll load a dataset containing data on the 1000 highest grossing Hollwood movies of all time. Data come from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sanjeetsinghnaik/top-1000-highest-grossing-movies). 

```{r}
Movies <- read_csv("Highest_Hollywood_Grossing_Movies.csv")
head(Movies)
```

Clean the data in the following ways:    
1) Create separate variables for year and title and remove any excess characters from each.  
2) Create a variable containing the release month    
3) Create separate variables called `hr` and one called `min` containing the hours and minutes of the film. Eliminate any excess characters, and ensure they are both numeric.  

```{r}
#Type code here
```


### Example 2.5.3: Working with Factor Variables   {-}

We load data from a sample of responses to the General Social survey, between 2000 and 2014. 

```{r}
data("gss_cat")
GSS <- gss_cat
head(GSS)
```

The `levels` command displays categories of a categorical variable. 

```{r}
levels(GSS$partyid)
```

The `count` command shows the number of people in each cetegory.   

```{r}
GSS %>% count(partyid)
```

```{r}
GSS %>% count(relig)
```


The `fct_recode` command allows us to change the names of the levels, or categories.  

The `fct_lmp` function groups together categories that are not among the n most frequent, into a category called "other". 


```{r}
GSS <- GSS %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer",
    "Other"                 = "Don't know",
    "Other"                 = "Other party"), 
    relig = fct_lump(relig, n=5))
head(GSS)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=GSS %>% filter(partyid!="Other")) + geom_bar(aes(x=relig, fill=partyid), position="fill")  
```

#### Practice 2.5.4   {-}

Modify the `maritial` variable to indicate whether a person has ever been married. That is, Married, Widowed, Divorced, and Separated should all be listed as "Yes", never married as "No", and No Answer as NA.  

Also, group the `denom` variable to include only the 10 most prevelant denominations, and classify people not belonging to those denominations as `other`.  

```{r}
#Type code here
```

### Example 2.5.5: Dates and Times {-}

The `lubridate` package is useful for working with dates and times.   

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```

We'll read in a .csv file containing columns of dates, listed in various formats, as well as a fictional number of sales on those days. 

```{r}
Dates <- read.csv('Dates.csv')
```

```{r}
Dates
```


When we try to plot these data, we get something nonsensical. Notice that R thinks of the column headings as character variables, not dates and times.  

```{r}
ggplot(data=Dates, aes(x=DateA, y=Sales)) + geom_point()
```


If we can get R to recognize the date columns as dates, it will be able to use them in meaningful ways, such as creating graphs. 

We can tell R to treat a date-like variable as a date using the `dmy`, `ymd`, or `mdy` commands, in accordance with the order month, day, and year are given. 

```{r}
Dates <- Dates %>% mutate(DateA = dmy(DateA))
Dates
```


```{r}
ggplot(data=Dates, aes(x=DateA, y=Sales)) + geom_point()
```

We can also use commands like `dmy_hm` or `dmy_hms` when the variable contains hours, minutes, and seconds. 

```{r}
Dates <- Dates %>% mutate(DateB = ymd(DateB),
                          DateC = mdy_hm(DateC))
Dates
```



### Practice 2.5.6    {-}

Convert DateD, DateE, and DateF to appropriate date and/or time variables.  

```{r}
#Type code here
```


### Example 2.5.7 Creating Date Variable    {-}

We can combine columns to create a date. 

The `nycflights13` package contains data on flights departing from New York City in 2013.  

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
head(flights)
```

We'll combine year, month, day, hour, and minute into a single variable, called `departure`. We tell R to make this into a date and time variable using the `make_datetime` command. 

```{r}
flights_dt <- flights  %>% 
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute))  
head(flights_dt)
```

We plot number of departures by time. 


```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(departure)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 86400) # 86400 seconds = 1 day
```

We plot number of departures on a single day, January 1, 2013 by time.  

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  filter(departure < ymd(20130102)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(departure)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 600) # 600 s = 10 minutes
```
  
  
### Example 2.5.8 `today` and `now`    {-}

The `today` and `now` functions return the current date and time. 
  
```{r}
today()
now()
```

What happens if we convert between dates and times?

```{r}
as_datetime(today())
as_date(now())
```
